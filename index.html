		<td style="outline:thin solid"> I am currently enrolled in the course, Topics in Computing, here at The University of Georgia which is what prompted this web page to be created. Besides taking this course, I am also a fourth year student studying psychology, women's studies, and personal/organizational leadership here at UGA. After I obtain my bachelor's degree, I plan to go on to obtain my PhD in <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology.</span> What is I/O Psych? I'm glad you asked (even if you didn't ask I'm still going to tell you so I can meet the word requirement). Well, Psychology is the study of human behavior, right? I/O Psychology is essentially the study of people in the context of their work environment. This can mean studying the industrial outcomes like hiring, firing, succession, talent management, etc. OR it can mean studying the organizational outcomes like company culture, job-satisfaction, motivation, leadership, teams, etc. The list goes on and on. </td>
		<td style="outline:thin solid"> I am heavily involved in residence life here at UGA. When I'm not studying or attending a meeting you can probably find me reading a book by a female comedian (they are hilarious and a good break from studying) or taking a nap. </td>
